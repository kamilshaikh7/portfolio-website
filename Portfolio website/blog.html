              Web development refers to the building, creating, and maintaining
              of websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web
              publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the
              creation of an application that works over the internet i.e.
              websites. A front-end dev takes care of layout, design and
              interactivity using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They take an idea
              from the drawing board and turn it into reality. What you see and
              what you use, such as the visual aspect of the website, the drop
              down menus and the text, are all brought together by the front-end
              dev, who writes a series of programmes to bind and structure the
              elements, make them look good and add interactivity. These
              programmes are run through a browser. The backend developer
              engineers what is going on behind the scenes. This is where the
              data is stored, and without this data, there would be no frontend.
              The backend of the web consists of the server that hosts the
              website, an application for running it and a database to contain
              the data. The backend dev uses computer programmes to ensure that
              the server, the application and the database run smoothly
              together. This type of dev need to analyse what a company’s needs
              are and provide efficient programming solutions. To do all this
              amazing stuff they use a variety of server-side languages, like
              PHP, Ruby, Python and Java. Web development is the coding or
              programming that enables website functionality, per the owner's
              requirements. It mainly deals with the non-design aspect of
              building websites, which includes coding and writing markup.
              <br />
              Web development ranges from creating plain text pages to complex
              web-based applications, social network applications and electronic
              business applications. The web development hierarchy is as
              follows: <br /><br />
              1). Client-side coding.&nbsp; 2). Server-side coding.&nbsp; 3).
              Database technology. <br /><br />
              Most web devs use Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading
              Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript to develop websites. HTML
              defines the basic framework of a website, the foundation upon
              which everything else is built upon. It forms the blocks that
              define a page's layout, format, and critical components. Although
              it is theoretically possible to code a website on HTML only, it
              will be just a barebone site with no functions unless it’s
              enriched with CSS and JavaScript. Also, even simple style
              modifications such as changing the color of a button require a lot
              of coding to be executed using HTML only.
              <br />CSS is used to style the content of a website using a small
              set of files that are kept across the entire site. This way,
              whenever a change must be applied to say, consistently change the
              color of all the buttons found in every page of the website, a web
              dev needs to edit only a single file in CSS. <br />The JavaScript
              programming language is used to take care of the interactivity of
              many unique website elements. It can be used to create effects
              that alter the appearance of icons and drop-down menus, add
              animations, games, and other interactive elements. Web developers
              are usually divided into front-end devs, back-end devs, and
              full-stack devs. A front-end dev takes care of all the visual
              aspects of the website (layout, navigation bar, etc.), its
              interactivity, and binds together all its elements. Back-end devs
              take care of less visible tasks that ensure the website runs
              smoothly, such as managing the website's hosting services,
              database, and applications. Back-end devs might need to engineer
              solution to server issues by using additional server-side
              languages such as Python, Ruby, Java, and PHP. Full-stack devs are
              developers able to do both front-end and back-end tasks at the
              same time.

              Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has
              efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective
              approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax
              and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it
              an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development
              in many areas on most platforms. The Python interpreter and the
              extensive standard library are freely available in source or
              binary form for all major platforms from the Python web site,
              https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same
              site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free
              third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional
              documentation. The Python interpreter is easily extended with new
              functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other
              languages callable from C). <br />
              Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable
              applications. This tutorial introduces the reader informally to
              the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system.
              It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on
              experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial
              can be read off-line as well. For a description of standard
              objects and modules, see The Python Standard Library. <br />
              The Python Language Reference gives a more formal definition of
              the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read Extending and
              Embedding the Python Interpreter and Python/C API Reference
              Manual. There are also several books covering Python in depth.
              This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every
              single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it
              introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will
              give you a good idea of the language’s flavor and style. After
              reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and
              programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various
              Python library modules described in The Python Standard Library.
              Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core,
              Python was designed to be highly extensible (with modules). <br />
              This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a
              means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications.
              Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard
              library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his
              frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.[40]
              Python strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar
              while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In
              contrast to Perl's "there is more than one way to do it" motto,
              Python embraces a "there should be one— and preferably only one
              —obvious way to do it" design philosophy.[67] Alex Martelli, a
              Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author,
              writes that "To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a
              compliment in the Python culture."[68] Python's developers strive
              to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to
              non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that
              would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of
              clarity.[69] When speed is important, a Python programmer can move
              time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages
              such as C, or use PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also
              available, which translates a Python script into C and makes
              direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter. Python's
              developers aim for the language to be fun to use.

              Web Development Tools help the developers to work with a variety
              of technologies. Web Development Tools should be able to provide
              faster mobile development at lower costs. They should help the
              developers in creating a responsive design. Responsive web design
              will improve the online browsing experience, and facilitate
              improved SEO, lower bounce rates, and lower maintenance needs.
              Moreover, the Front End Development Tool that you choose should be
              Scalable.
